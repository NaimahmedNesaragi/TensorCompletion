# TensorCompletion
Given partial observation of a low rank tensor (possibly including noise), attempts to complete it.

Requires working installations of Manopt 3.0 and MATLAB Tensor Toolbox 2.6.

Copy the file "low_rank_tensor_completion_embedded.m" into the manopt/examples directory and the file "embedded_tensor_factory.m" into the manopt/manopt/manifolds directory.
